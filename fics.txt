- please check what the page looks like when you exit customise and open it in a new tab before telling me it's not working!
- if you tag fics with "fave" a heart will appear in the corner.
- if you tag fics with "complete ao3" a tick will appear in the corner.
- if you don't want the star rating, search for 32% and replace it with 49%, then just delete the <span>★★★★</span> from each box. 
- to replace the accent color, search for #a4afc1 and replace it with a color of your choice using colorpicker.

<p>“Hyung,” Jungkook had buried his face in Taehyung’s chest, “tell me what to do.” </p>

Kim Taehyung doesn't let anyone to get close to him more than he allows them, always surrounded by the strong walls so that no one can know the reality. He's a determined young guy who wants to show the world what he's capable of, even when the ghosts from the past haunt him---

<p>Even when he wants someone to embrace him tightly despite telling them he doesn't need anyone. And he's extremely scared how Jeon Jeongguk affects him in ways he can't even describe.</p>

If a fated mate is a person made for you, a soulmate is the other half of your soul that will complete you and make you full for the first time. No one will ever love you like them, and you’ll never love anyone as you love them.

<p> Then why… Why is Taehyung feeling like someone ripped his very own soul, why is he feeling like his heart stopped beating and was thrown into freezing water, why is he feeling like every nightmare he has ever had is better than listening to the hurtful words his soulmate is saying to him..?

After years, he makes it to the top of his company and he is paired with Jeongguk, one of the best actors there are and he is excited. They are great partners on screen but it is hard for Taehyung to breach Jeongguk&rsquo;s walls when they are off cameras. When he finally suceeds, they quickly make a way into each other&rsquo;s heart but it&rsquo;s not easy because love isn&rsquo;t a movie, not even an adult one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeongguk and Taehyung attend a private college in Seoul but their lives are completely opposite. Taehyung comes from one of the most elite and richest family and he was born with golden spoon in his mouth, while Jeongguk is just a regular guy from middle class. Their worlds are completely different and Taehyung has never spared Jeongguk a glance. There is one minor problem &ndash; Jeongguk has had crush on the rich boy since he first saw him.</p>
<p>Once, Jeongguk attends a fancy event and things take interesting turn. Taehyung, who is cold and perfect on the outside, is in reality just misunderstood and lonely, sick of the fancy and pompous life, parties and people and he finds escape from that boring life with Jeongguk. What will happen when their opposite worlds collide? Will they crush or will they create a whole new world of their own?</p>

<p>Taehyung has been a fan of idol Jeon Jeongguk since the beginning of his career. He was drawn to him by his music and beautiful voice and personality, even though he can&rsquo;t appreciate his visuals because he is blind. His friends gift him tickets to a fan sign for his birthday and he meets his idol and talks to him. But then crazy thing happens, Jeongguk&rsquo;s manager comes to an animal shelter where he works, saying the idol wants to see him again and so it begins. Taehyung never thought he could live normal and happy life due to his condition, but being with Jeongguk shows him that he doesn&rsquo;t need his sight to be truly happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this time and age, vampires are a rare species. Most of people are happy to avoid them but Taehyung&rsquo;s been always fascinated by them &ndash; too bad that it&rsquo;s really hard to come across one. Taehyung is just a university student but he goes often out at night in hope of meeting one of the mystery creatures. He gets lucky one evening and it turns out into the craziest and the best night of his life. After that, he becomes even more obsessed, dragging his friend Jimin into it.</p>
<p>Crazy and unexpected thing happens. Taehyung stumbles upon a very unusual advertisement - a small vampire clan is looking for fresh blood suppliers, aka humans. Taehyung&rsquo;s obsession introduces him to a whole new, exciting and dangerous world. And if he finds love on the way, that is just another coincidence.</p>

<p>Taehyung and Jeongguk were forced to mate by their parents when they were younger. Taehyung&rsquo;s parents needed money for their farm so Taehyung&rsquo;s father made a deal with Jeongguk&rsquo;s rich father. They were both furious when they found out and even though they were occasionally hooking up, they never fell for each other. They&rsquo;ve thought about rebelling and breaking their bond but it is a painful process, so they were basically just coexisting together.</p>
<p>Few years into their weird relationship, Taehyung is still acting like an irresponsible teenager most of the time, making the alpha&rsquo;s life harder. Jeongguk is drinking a lot, trying to deal with the whole mess. They are dragging each other down but lifting each other up at the same time. Most of the time it feels like they are two strangers living together but there are moments when suddenly all bad is gone. On their long and bumpy journey, they start realizing that they need each other and that maybe there are some real feelings buried deep inside.</p>
